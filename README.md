# tython
Security as code framework

Tython is an open source security as code framework from oak9 that lets you define security reference architectures as code (Blueprints) in the language of your choice.  oak9's security blueprints use this same framework to codify industry security reference architectures from NIST, Cloud Security Alliance (CSA), AWS, Azure, GCP and others. This open source project will enable developers and security professionals to build their own Blueprints and contribute them back to the community.

# Background

Tython not only happens to be the birthplace of the Je'Daii Order (a precursor to the Jedi), it also is a portmanteau for the first two programming languages that we have built support for - Typescript and Python.

# Prerequisites

* oak9 SaC framework for the language of your choice
* golang


# Guiding Principles

* Focus on value to security and dev teams
* Build resuable security reference architectures
* Create transparency in the security design
* Enable collaboration, autonomy and shared responsiblity across Dev and Security
* Consider the lifecycle management of security architectures
* Enable scalable security reference architectures
* Cloud and technology agnostic approach
