Security as code framework

Tython is an open source security as code framework from [oak9](https://www.oak9.io) that lets you define security reference architectures as code (Blueprints) in the language of your choice.  oak9's security blueprints use this same framework to codify industry security reference architectures from NIST, Cloud Security Alliance (CSA), AWS, Azure, GCP and others. This open source project will enable developers and security professionals to build their own Blueprints and contribute them back to the community.

> **_NOTE:_**  We are going through some remodeling of this repo.  Please contact support if you have any questions.

# Background

Tython not only happens to be the birthplace of the Je'Daii Order (a precursor to the Jedi), it also is a portmanteau for the first two programming languages that we have built support for - Typescript and Python.
